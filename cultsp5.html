            <h1>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h1>
            <p>Learning is an individual experience which is different for each person, I learned so many things like knowledge, developing 
                skills etc. Mainly in this foundation how to solve the problem in coding. Sometime i frustrated when i was stuck then took 
            some break and then start my work. </p>
            <h1>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
            <p>The role of values is to develop patience, good manners and honesty etc. Empathy is an 
                important part of human-centered design. The role of empathy involve in the learning design process, 
                opening up more opportunities to get results that suit their needs. Empathy is usually done by teachers in 
                understanding classroom conditions.In self awareness also important how to manage your emotions when you are working in group.
            </p>
            <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
            <p>Javascript is not a easy programming.If anybody want to learn then we have to spend more time for learnings.
                In my learning so many challanges are surprised.because it was very hard for me when i was stuck.
                But i enjoyed every challange in this learning. 
            </p>
            <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development 
                bootcamp course?</h1>
                <p>Because in every company need expert person in programming. EDA is a also one learning school only focus on practical
                    programming, in my point of view we want to spend more time in practical work then we learn how to 
                    solve the problem. 
                </p>
            <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing 
                programming instead?</h1>
                <p>I spend more time for learning. Spend more time learn more things. If anybody learn programming then need more practicing
                    in programming.
                </p>
