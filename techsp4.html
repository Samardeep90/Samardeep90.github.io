        <h1>PROBLEM SOLVING</h1>
        <p>Problems are everywhere. Their magnitude and impact might be different, 
            but the general problem solving strategies are the same.I stuck in Kata strategies.
            I knew things were becoming more and more challenging.I was working in JS-gradebook on repl.it when i create a 
            function to work average of students testScores. It is case senstive language I didnot put Capital 'S' in testscores.
            I received a error but my function is correct. then change the testScore then it works.This challenge taught me the 
            importance of checking for spelling and syntax mistakes and using the error messages to help me solve the problem. 
            </p>
        <h2>PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES AND PROCESSES</h2>
        <h2>PSEUDOCODE</h2>
        <p>Every time I face a challenge.pseudocode a very important step in problem-solving process,It allows me to 
            break the large challenge into smaller part tasks and to have a greater understanding of what code will do.</p>
        <h2>TRYING SOMETHING</h2>
        <p>In this you have to try to solve problems if it works then its good if not then you have to spend more time to solve it.</p>
        <h2>RUBBER DUCKY METHOD</h2>
        <p>In this method you will find your problem. I donot have a rubber ducky.But i spend some time with my baby.</p>
        <h2>READING ERROR MESSAGES</h2>
        <p>In Javascript if any mistake in coding. then showing error message.Reading these messages  carefully, it also help to 
            debug the problem. for example it is syntex error, brackets etc.</p>
            <h2>CONSOLE.LOGGING</h2>
            <p>console.log() is a function that writes a message to log on the console.</p>
        <h2>GOOGLING</h2>
        <p>It is very valueable platform to find answers for every question.</p>
        <h2>ASKING YOUR PEERS AND COACHES FOR HELP</h2>
        <p>All my team mates and facilitator  are very helpful.when I stuck then everyone help me to solve the chalanges.</p>
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>I have been working on challanges,I enjoyed in this sprint challanges like kata.I spend more time in JS gradebook and 
            built-in-method. I will spend more time in summer break to learn coding.</p>
