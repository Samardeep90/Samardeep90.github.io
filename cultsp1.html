            <h1>Identity, values, and strengths exploration</h1>
            <h2>Describe your core personal values</h2>
            <p>Authenticity, compassion, loyalty, harmony, fairness, and equality.</p>
            <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
                Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
                the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
                <p>Being power of attorney for my mother and signing a DNR order. 
                    She had an incurable, degenerative disease which had already taken years of 
                    her life and much of her mobility (throughout which she also battled cancer). 
                    She was so frail, her health had come to a stage where her care facility suggested 
                    I look at the DNR consent form and talked through whether to sign it or not. 
                    In the case that she needed CPR, though it may save her life and keep her 
                    going, the compressions required could be painful or traumatic and may leave 
                    her in an even worse condition. The chance of her needing the CPR was slim, 
                    and I had to think compassionately about what was best for her. I made the 
                    decision to sign the DNR. There weren’t consequences as such – no family 
                    member disagreed with the decision and when she did pass away it was in her 
                    sleep.</p>
            <h2>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h2>   
            <p>Strengths: attention to detail, humour, improver, adaptability, 
                emotional awareness, curiosity, organiser, service, judgement, 
                team work.</p>     
            <p>Limitations: not a time-optimiser, self-belief does not come easily, 
                not always centred, perfectionist.</p>    
            <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2> 
            <p>In terms of a wider culture I find this quite hard to answer as a Pakeha. 
                Certainly from within family culture I think my values emerged from an 
                environment where they were less than abundant. I think my strengths helped 
                me to survive in that culture, too.</p>   
            <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey 
                and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
            <p>Attention to detail is great for not just focusing on the big picture of a 
                project but also small facets of it and the minor actions that are required 
                to accomplish the project. However it can clash with time-optimising if I 
                focus on the details for longer than necessary to get the project done.
