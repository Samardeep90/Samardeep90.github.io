           <h1>What is a Learning Plan?</h1>
           <p>A learning plan is a description of how you intend to achieve your 
               desired outcomes in learning. The plan can be very helpful in showing 
               clarity and progress in your learning. It also can ensure that your 
               activities learning activities will be very efficient and orderly.</p>
            <p>Beforehand developing a plan, it helps to be specific about what 
                learning actually means. Educators interpret learning to be new:</p>
            <ol><li>Knowledge is information that will be useful somehow, for example, 
                in solving a problem, achieving a goal or otherwise accomplishing something 
                important in life.</li>
            <li>Skills are developed by applying the new knowledge over time.</li>
            <li>Abilities are intuitive capacities developed by applying the skills over time.</li></ol>
            <h1>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
            <p>I want to use my strengths to help people and contribute to society through 
                meaningful work. Long term goal is to work in a role where I don’t need to 
                sacrifice my values so much and that plays to my strengths. I’ve made myself 
                work in roles that don’t play to my strengths as a means of furthering development 
                and while I have worked hard, succeeded and grown, I’ve done it to such a 
                point it affects my health. I don’t mean that I don’t want to be challenged, 
                just not to the degree I’ve put myself through previously.</p>
