           <h1>What is a Learning Plan?</h1>
           <p>A learning plan is a description of how you intend to achieve your 
               desired outcomes in learning. The plan can be very helpful in showing 
               clarity and progress in your learning. It also can ensure that your 
               activities learning activities will be very efficient and orderly.</p>
            <p>Beforehand developing a plan, it helps to be specific about what 
                learning actually means. Educators interpret learning to be new:</p>
            <ol><li>Knowledge is information that will be useful somehow, for example, 
                in solving a problem, achieving a goal or otherwise accomplishing something 
                important in life.</li>
            <li>Skills are developed by applying the new knowledge over time.</li>
            <li>Abilities are intuitive capacities developed by applying the skills over time.</li></ol>
            <h2>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>I want to use my strengths to help people and contribute to society through 
                meaningful work. Long term goal is to work in a role where I donâ€™t need to 
                sacrifice my values so much and that plays to my strengths.</p>
            <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
            <p>To be able to work in a team collaboratively. To manage my time and self-direction.</p>
            <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>
            <p>I'm friendly, a team player, and I get passionate about problem 
                solving. My limitations are: not being able to time-management, stress.</p>
            <h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will 
                manage your workload in this programme. This should include - 
                an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively 
                and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community 
                representatives.</h2>
            <p>I will commit myself to doing at least a little bit of work a day. 
                I will plan out my time so I can complete things in a timely manner.</p>
            <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
            <p>When I require help, after I have tried debugging and searching the internet 
                I will ensure I either ask my peers via slack or asking my facilitator 
                directly.</p>
            <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h2>
            <p>I expect an open and honest relationship with the facilitators s
                I can feel fully comfortable to come to them for help and technical support.</p>
            <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed 
                to other things.</h2>
            <p>I will block in time in the morning and evenings</p>
