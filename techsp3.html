        <h2>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTML AND CSS</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is the language which is used 
            to define the structure of a web page. HTML is used along with CSS and Java 
            script to design web pages. HTML is the basic building block of a website. It 
            has different attributes and elements with different properties.Each element 
            has a opening and a closing tag. We can also add images by the help of HTML.</p>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used to style web documents. 
            It is used to provide the background color and is also used for styling. It 
            can also be used to style the font and change its size. We can also style 
            many different web pages with the same specifications by the help of CSS. 
            CSS is also recommended by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It can also 
            be used along with HTML and Java script to design web pages.</p>
        <h2>CONTROL FLOW AND LOOPS</h2>
        <p>Loops are useful for when you need to do the same task multiple times, 
            or even forever. An analogy would be a thermostat. When you set a thermostat, 
            the thermostat will check the temperature. If the room temperature is below the 
            target temperature, the thermostat will tell the heater to turn on, if the room 
            temperature is equal to or above the target temperature it will tell the heater 
            to turn off. It has to do this repeatedly to ensure the room is at the right 
            temperature which is why a loop is necessary.</p>
        <h2>WHAT IS A DOM?</h2>
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent 
            interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each 
            node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a 
            document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each 
            node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with 
            them one can change the structure, style or content of a document.When a web 
            page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page, which 
            is an object oriented representation of an HTML document that acts as an interface 
            between JavaScript and the document itself. This allows the creation of dynamic 
            web pages,because within a page JavaScript can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add, change, and remove any of the HTML elements and attributes</li>
            <li>change any of the CSS styles</li>
            <li>react to all the existing events</li>
            <li>create new events</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCESSING DATA FROM ARRAYS AND OBJECTS</h2>
        <p>Ever seen some data in square brackets and curly brackets in JavaScript? 
            These are Arrays and Objects respectively.Objects are used to represent 
            a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, 
            a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined 
            by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called 
            properties that consist of a key and a value.</p>

        <p>We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items 
            in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered 
            collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical 
            position in the list.</p>

        <h2>WHAT ARE FUNCTIONS IN JAVASCRIPT?</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name 
            and then execute it as many times as you want.A JavaScript function can be defined 
            using function keyword.</p>
