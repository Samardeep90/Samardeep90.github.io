            <h1>WHAT IS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
            <P>Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand,
             use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, 
             empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. 
             Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, 
             and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your feelings, 
             turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you.</P>
             <ul><h2>Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:</h2></ul>
             <ul><li><h3>Self-management</h3></li>
             <p>You’re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, 
                 take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.</p></ul>
                <ul><li><h3>Self-awareness </h3></li>
                <p>You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. 
                    You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence.</p></ul>
                    <ul><li><h3>Social-awareness</h3> </li><p>You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, 
                        and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and 
                        recognize the power dynamics in a group or organization.</p></ul>
                        <ul><li><h3>Relationship management </h3></li><p>You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, 
                            communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict.</p></ul>
            <h2>WHY IS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE SO IMPORTANT</h2>
            <p>As we know, it’s not the smartest people who are the most successful or the most fulfilled in life. 
                You probably know people who are academically brilliant and yet are socially inept and unsuccessful 
                at work or in their personal relationships. Intellectual ability or your intelligence quotient (IQ) 
                isn’t enough on its own to achieve success in life. Yes, your IQ can help you get into college, 
                but it’s your EQ that will help you manage the stress and emotions when facing your final exams. 
                IQ and EQ exist in tandem and are most effective when they build off one another.</p>
