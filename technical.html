            <h1>HOW TO USE CLASS AND ID IN HTML</h1>
            <p>When using HTML, there will come a point where you want to start styling your page. 
                Perhaps you want all of your titles to be underlined, or a paragraph of text to be blue. 
                In order to know what to style, CSS uses selectors.</p>
            <h2>CLASS</h2>
            <p>Class is used when you want to style multiple elements in the same way. 
                For example, if you have multiple headers in your page which you'd like to be green and underlined, 
                you would give them all the same class name (E.g. class="text-blog"). 
                This saves you from writing out the same style multiple times. To select a class, you must put a '.' 
                before your class name in your CSS file.</p>
            <h2>ID</h2>
            <p>ID is used when you want to specifically style one element. 
                For example, if I want only one of my headers to be red and not underlined, but the rest green and underlined, 
                I would give my red header an ID selector (E.g. ID="text-red-blog"). 
                To select an element's ID, you must put a '#' before your ID name in your CSS file.</p>
